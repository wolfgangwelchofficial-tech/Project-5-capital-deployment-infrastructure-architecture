## Sequencing Logic

Capital was deployed in controlled phases:

Phase 1 – Structural Readiness  
Phase 2 – Regulatory Submission  
Phase 3 – Vendor Integration  
Phase 4 – Technology & Reporting Build  
Phase 5 – Hiring & Training  
Phase 6 – Marketing Activation  

Liquidity buffer was protected to absorb licensing delays beyond construction completion.
