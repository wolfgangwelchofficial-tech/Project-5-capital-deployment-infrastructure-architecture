# Integrated Operating Stack Architecture

The technology ecosystem was designed as a closed-loop control system.

Each platform served a defined layer of operational governance.

The objective was not convenience.

The objective was margin visibility, labor control, compliance integrity, and customer data capture prior to scale.

## System Architecture Overview

Revenue Layer → SmartTab  
Inventory Layer → Barkeep  
Labor & Scheduling → 7Shifts  
Payroll & HR → Gusto  
Customer Data → Vemos  
Communication Layer → Slack  

These systems were selected based on:

- Interoperability where possible
- Domain strength where necessary
- Reduction of manual reconciliation risk
- Prevention of operational guessing

---

## Revenue Instrumentation (SmartTab)

The POS was configured intentionally:

- Spirit categories segmented (tequila, vodka, whiskey, etc.)
- Bottle service and bar revenue separated
- Modifiers structured to prevent leakage
- Comp and void tracking enabled
- Pour-cost calculated from bottle acquisition cost

Revenue taxonomy was built before first transaction.

---

## Inventory Governance (Barkeep)

Inventory tracking included:

- Full SKU-level cost mapping
- Depletion from POS transaction data
- Invoice logging and cost validation
- Pre-order and post-delivery count cycles

Deviation tolerance: ±1 bottle variance.

If breached:

- POS audit protocol initiated
- Recount triggered
- Staff transaction review performed

Variance threshold was never exceeded.

Control system prevented breach.

---

## Labor Optimization (7Shifts)

Scheduling architecture included:

- Labor vs revenue visibility
- Tip pooling tracking
- Automated hour capture into payroll
- Task management system for:
    - Daily cleaning responsibilities
    - Weekly operational checks
    - Monthly maintenance discipline

Labor was reviewed weekly against revenue density.

Scheduling was aligned to peak revenue windows.

---

## Payroll & Compliance (Gusto)

Payroll stack included:

- Automated onboarding
- Direct deposit
- Compliance documentation
- HR tracking
- Integration with 7Shifts hours

Payroll and compliance risk were centralized into a single control platform.

---

## Customer Data & CRM (Vemos)

Vemos provided:

- ID verification scanning
- Customer visit tracking
- CRM capture
- Repeat-visit data layer

Customer data infrastructure was institutional before stabilization.

---

## Weekly Governance Loop

Every Monday:

1. Revenue report pulled from SmartTab.
2. Inventory report pulled from Barkeep.
3. Labor vs sales report reviewed from 7Shifts.
4. Payroll integration verified via Gusto.
5. Variance cross-check performed across systems.
6. Vendor orders calculated and placed.

This created a manual cross-system reconciliation protocol.

No system operated in isolation.

---

## Strategic Outcome

The stack produced:

- Margin visibility before scale
- Leakage prevention
- Labor alignment
- Inventory precision
- Compliance centralization
- Customer data capture

Operational stability was engineered before revenue stabilized.
