# Licensing & Regulatory Sequence Map

Operations were construction-ready at month three.

Regulatory clearance extended timeline to month eight.

## Regulatory Dependencies

1. City Business License
2. Alcohol Licensing Approval
3. Fire Marshal Inspection
4. Building Inspection Sign-off
5. Conditional Operating Clearance

Each stage required sequential validation.

Failure at any stage delayed launch authorization.

## Bottleneck Analysis

Primary friction points:

- Inspection scheduling latency
- Documentation review cycles
- Conditional compliance adjustments
- Cross-departmental approval coordination

---

## Risk Mitigation

To preserve capital during delay:

- Working capital buffer maintained
- Vendor onboarding staggered
- Payroll ramp delayed until conditional approval clarity
- Marketing executed without fixed opening date commitment
