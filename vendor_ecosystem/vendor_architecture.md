# Vendor Ecosystem Architecture

Vendor relationships were structured as an integrated operating ecosystem.

Objective: Prevent fragmented procurement and contract misalignment.

---

## Vendor Categories

- POS Lease Provider
- Sound & Lighting Equipment
- Soda Distributor
- Liquor Supplier
- Consumable & Reusable Product Suppliers

---

## Design Principles

1. Avoid overlapping contract redundancies.
2. Negotiate scalable terms.
3. Align vendor cadence with projected revenue flow.
4. Prevent long-term lock-in under uncertain stabilization.

---

## Strategic Leverage

Vendor sequencing was staggered:

- Infrastructure vendors secured during remodel.
- Inventory vendors activated near regulatory clearance.
- Liquidity-sensitive contracts delayed until approval certainty.

Vendor architecture supported capital preservation.
