# Vendor Ecosystem Architecture Under Liquidity Constraint

Vendor relationships were not simply procurement decisions.

They were capital exposure commitments activated before revenue certainty.

---

## Infrastructure Vendors (Pre-Revenue Commitment)

Contracts activated prior to launch:

- POS Lease ($1,200/month)
- Sound & Lighting Lease ($2,500/month)

These contracts began generating burn before regulatory approval.

They were required to complete infrastructure readiness.

Deferring activation was not viable without delaying remodel completion.

---

## Operational Vendors (Staggered Activation)

Vendors intentionally delayed until regulatory clearance:

- Liquor suppliers
- Soda distributors
- Consumable product vendors
- Inventory acquisition

Inventory purchase was compressed into final approval window to prevent dead capital lock-up.

---

## Contract Structure Philosophy

Because payments were made in cash:

- No deferred payment leverage.
- No credit-based runway extension.
- No vendor financing safety net.

Vendor architecture required sequencing discipline.

Infrastructure was committed.
Operational vendors were staged.

---

## Exposure Mapping

Pre-clearance exposure included:

- Fixed lease burn
- Equipment lease burn
- Insurance
- Utilities
- Marketing (June onward)

Operational activation was delayed to prevent compounding exposure.

---

## Strategic Insight

Vendor architecture is rarely discussed in capital deployment.

But under regulatory drag, vendor timing becomes a survival lever.

Infrastructure must be ready.
Inventory must wait.

This sequencing preserved final activation liquidity.
