# POS & SaaS Integration Model

Technology was implemented prior to launch to prevent improvisation.

Infrastructure included:

- POS configuration & revenue categorization
- Labor cost tracking model
- Reporting worksheets
- KPI baseline template
- Vendor reconciliation tracking

---

## Architecture Logic

Revenue categories were standardized before first transaction.

Labor allocation mapping was structured prior to hiring scale.

Reporting worksheets mirrored future governance structures.

Data integrity preceded revenue generation.

---

## Strategic Rationale

Post-launch retroactive system design introduces variance.

Infrastructure was built before doors opened to ensure:

- Revenue comparability
- Margin visibility
- Forecast modeling readiness
