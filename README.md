# Capital Deployment & Infrastructure Architecture
EMG Management | Founder-Operator | Reno, NV

---

## Executive Summary

This project documents the full-spectrum capital deployment and infrastructure design behind a $500,000 self-funded acquisition and remodel.

The objective was not simply to open a venue.

The objective was to engineer a stable, revenue-ready operating system before first dollar earned.

This required:

- Capital allocation discipline
- Regulatory navigation under friction
- Vendor ecosystem architecture
- SaaS and POS infrastructure design
- Policy and reporting system buildout
- Pre-launch revenue activation strategy

Infrastructure preceded revenue.
Control preceded scale.

## Capital at Risk

Total self-funded capital deployed: **$500,000**

The capital model was structured across:

- Physical remodel & buildout
- Equipment & technology
- Licensing & regulatory compliance
- Vendor contracts
- Pre-opening payroll buffer
- Marketing & brand activation
- Working capital reserve

Capital was sequenced to prevent liquidity compression during licensing delays.

- [Capital Deployment Structure](capital_model/capital_deployment_structure.md)

## Regulatory Navigation & Licensing Friction

The Reno licensing environment required multi-stage approvals including:

- City licensing
- Alcohol licensing
- Fire inspection
- Building inspection
- Conditional approval sequencing

Operations were construction-complete at month three, but regulatory delay extended total timeline to eight months.

This required liquidity preservation and adaptive sequencing.

## Vendor Ecosystem Architecture

All vendor contracts were designed from first principles:

- POS lease & configuration
- Sound & lighting equipment
- Soda and beverage vendors
- Liquor supplier relationships
- Consumable and reusable products

The objective was not vendor accumulation.

It was ecosystem integration.

- [Vendor Architecture Model](vendor_ecosystem/vendor_architecture.md)

## Technology Stack Design

Technology was implemented before launch to prevent operational improvisation.

Stack included:

- POS configuration
- Reporting worksheets
- Revenue tracking structure
- Labor tracking architecture
- SaaS integrations

Data integrity preceded opening night.

- [POS & SaaS Integration Model](technology_stack/pos_saas_integration_model.md)

## Pre-Opening Revenue Activation Strategy

Marketing began during construction.

Objectives:

- Build anticipation
- Capture early audience
- Establish positioning before opening
- Drive strong opening week revenue

This reduced launch volatility.

- [Pre-Opening Marketing Strategy](go_to_market/pre_opening_marketing_strategy.md)

## Strategic Outcome

By opening day:

- Infrastructure was institutional.
- Vendor systems were integrated.
- Reporting architecture existed.
- Marketing pipeline was active.
- Liquidity buffer was preserved.

The asset did not open as a startup experiment.

It opened as an engineered operating system.
