# Pre-Opening Revenue Activation Strategy

Marketing began during construction.

Objective: Open with revenue momentum, not brand uncertainty.

---

## Strategy Components

- Social media build-out
- Teaser campaigns
- Construction progress content
- Audience anticipation loops
- Early interest capture

---

## Risk Mitigation

No fixed launch date was publicly committed until regulatory clarity improved.

This preserved credibility while maintaining hype.

---

## Outcome

Strong opening week driven by:

- Pre-built awareness
- Anticipation during remodel
- Clear positioning before market entry

Marketing reduced volatility during first 30 days of operation.
